I've found that the domain registrar NameCheap adds an extra layer of confusion when trying to forward to a domain name.
I found [this post](http://ntdef.com/2015/09/04/adding-a-custom-domain-name-to-gh-pages/) to be helpful, and am noting it here for posterity.

GitHub's instructions could be better too, I feel.
