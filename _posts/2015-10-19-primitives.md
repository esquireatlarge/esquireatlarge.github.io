You may have heard the word "primitive" before in context of computing, but what is a primitive?
A primitive is a built-in type that can be used on its own or as part of a larger, more complex user-defined object (a class).

So what is an example of a primitive? 
Well, an `int` is a primitive, as is a `double`, `float`, `char`, `bool`.
Here is a list of primitives for C++:
```cpp
int
float
double
char
bool
wchar_t
void
```
